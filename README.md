# Trigger.dev API references

This repository provides job code samples that use either SDKs or the `fetch` method to interact with external APIs and Trigger.dev. Refer to these examples if you're working with APIs that don't have an official Trigger.dev integration yet.

For a full list of our official supported integrations please refer to [our integration docs](https://trigger.dev/docs/integrations/introduction):

## About Trigger.dev

Trigger.dev is a framework for creating long-running Jobs directly in your Next.js app with API integrations, webhooks, scheduling and delays. You can reliably run Jobs that wouldnâ€™t normally work in serverless environments (like Vercel) because of timeouts.

## Jobs in this repo:

These jobs can be run locally using the `@trigger.dev/cli` and `@trigger.dev/express` packages.

## Setup: how to use this repo

You will need to create a `.env` file. You can duplicate the contents of `.env.example` file and set your local (Dev 'server') `TRIGGER_API_KEY` value. You can find your API key in your project's integrations page [in the app](https://cloud.trigger.dev). Add other API keys as needed.

### Install packages

First, install the packages:

```sh
npm i
```

### Running a job

Each file in `src` is either a Job or a separate set of jobs that can be run separately. For example, the `src/cronScheduledBasic.ts` file can be run with:

```sh
npm run github
```

This will open up a local server using `express` on port 8080. Then in a <u>separate terminal window</u> you can run the `@trigger.dev/cli dev` command:

```sh
npm run dev:trigger
```

### Contributors guide

You can add a new file to `src` with it's own `TriggerClient` and set of jobs (e.g. `src/events.ts`)

```ts
import { TriggerClient, eventTrigger } from "@trigger.dev/sdk";
import { createExpressServer } from "@trigger.dev/express";
import { z } from "zod";

export const client = new TriggerClient({ id: "api-reference" });

client.defineJob({
  id: "example-job",
  name: "Example Job",
  version: "1.0.0",
  trigger: eventTrigger({
    name: "example.one",
  }),
  run: async (payload, io, ctx) => {},
});

createExpressServer(client);
```

Then add a new script in [`package.json`](./package.json):

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "events": "nodemon --watch src/events.ts -r tsconfig-paths/register -r dotenv/config src/events.ts"
  }
}
```
